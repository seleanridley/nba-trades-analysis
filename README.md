# Does the number of NBA trades/transactions in a season affect a teams's efficiency? 

Evaluting whether the number of NBA trades/transactions, which includes trades, free agent signings, draft picks, etc., has any impact on the performance of the team throughout the season. I will be measuring the correlation between a teams win percentage, playoff wins and finals appearances with the number of transactions during each season from the 2018-2019 season to the current one, 2020-2021. This analysis sets to provide quantitative evidence that team chemistry is a significat factor in a team's ability to be successful during the regular season and post-season.

**Audience**: NBA fanatics who obsess over every trade their favorite team may or may not make.

Data is gathered and scraped from the NBA API and from www.prosportstransactions.com/basketball, respectively.
